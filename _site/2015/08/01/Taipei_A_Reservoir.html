<p>Taipei: A Reservoir is a collateral publication to an ongoing site-specific project entitled “Simple Little Things.” This publication primarily focuses on Taiwanese culture and its slow-paced progressive lifestyle, narrated through a series of illustrated short stories. The content generated within this publication is intended to further elaborate on the concept of being able to archive, record, and document things that should have disappeared over time. Taipei has becomes a reservoir of preserved memories that I still have somewhat access to.</p>
