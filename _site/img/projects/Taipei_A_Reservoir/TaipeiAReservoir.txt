Taipei: A Reservoir is a collateral publication to an ongoing site-specific project entitled “Simple Little Things.” This publication primarily focuses on Taiwanese culture and its slow-paced progressive lifestyle, narrated through a series of illustrated short stories. The content generated within this publication is intended to further elaborate on the concept of being able to archive, record, and document things that should have disappeared over time. Taipei has becomes a reservoir of preserved memories that I still have somewhat access to.
 
The publication was written, illustrated, designed, printed and bound all within the course of a month and half. (developed in Taipei and made in New Jersey) Devoted to Taiwanese aesthetic, the book takes on a more illustrative and rather over the top approach. As the book is constructed using low-fidelity materials from local family-run stores in the Zhonghe area, I was interested in evoking the low cost efficiency in Taiwan. Within several chapters, there are insets of additional stories and illustration. This publication also strives to exist as a specimen of how simple little things can contribute to create something even more meaningful.
